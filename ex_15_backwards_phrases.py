#Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.
# Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.
# For example, say I type the string:
#
#  My name is Michele
# Then I would see the string:
#
#  Michele is name My
#
# shown back to me.
